## **Features of the Game**   
 ✔️ You don't have to start the game with the standard player names "X" and "O". By entering the names of the people who will play the game on the home screen, you can make the game address you with your name.  
 ✔️ Thanks to the timer, your opponent will play faster. Otherwise, it will be your turn.  
 ✔️ You will be able to see the games you won and lost on the leaderboard.  
 ✔️ Your opponent cannot fill in the fields you have filled.  
 ✔️ When the game ends in a draw, you can restart the game. You can see the number of games that ended in a draw on the leaderboard.
